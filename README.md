# CoolGeditTheme
# To use this theme simply download/clone the repository, the name of the repo should be CoolGeditTheme-master.zip
# The unzip the zip archive with following command:
# :~$ unzip CoolGeditTheme-master.zip
# To see if any pre-existing theme selections have been chosen by running the following command via command-line:
# :~$ ls $HOME/.local/share/gedit
# If the output of the ls command displays an error because the directory does not exist create directory with the following
# command:
# NOTE: If the $HOME/.local/share/gedit directory already exists the following command is not necessary!!
# :~$ mkdir -p -m0755 $HOME/.local/share/gedit
# After doing so add the theme to your theme selection by moving the 'styles' directory located in freshly unzipped
# CoolGeditTheme-master directory, by executing the command shown below:
# NOTE: If the $HOME/.local/share/gedit/styles directory already exists do not execute the following command!!
# :~$ mv $HOME/Downloads/CoolGeditTheme-master/styles $HOME/.local/share/gedit/
# NOTE: The previous command assumes that you downloaded the CoolGeditTheme-master.zip archive to you Downloads directory.
# You may have to adjust the according to where the extracted CoolGeditTheme-master directory resides.
# LAST POSSIBLE SCENARIO: If the $HOME/.local/share/gedit/styles directory already exists, simply execute the following command:
# :~$ mv $HOME/Downloads/CoolGeditTheme-master/styles/* $HOME/.local/share/gedit/styles
# Now you can select theme, as you normally would select a theme in you preferences! ;-)
